## Summary
**Goal:** Organize all 54 certifications in a structured, responsive grid layout with consistent styling.

- Refactor CertificationsGallery to display certifications in a uniform grid with consistent card dimensions
- Implement responsive grid system: 1 column (mobile), 2 columns (tablet), 3 columns (large tablet), 4 columns (desktop)
- Apply consistent styling to each card including aspect ratio preservation, rounded corners, shadows, and background colors matching the portfolio design

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see all certifications organized in a clean, responsive grid layout with uniform card sizes and consistent spacing across all devices.
