  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all three requirements (REQ-22, REQ-23, REQ-24). A download CV button was added to the HeroSection component with appropriate styling, icon, and responsive behavior. However, there is a discrepancy in the CV file name between the requirement specification and the actual implementation.",

      "requirement": "CV PDF file should be named 'Engr. Jerry E. Osiobe CV.pdf' in frontend/public/assets/ directory",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest specifies the CV file should be named 'Engr. Jerry E. Osiobe CV.pdf', but the implementation references '/assets/NEW CV.pdf' in the download link. The diff does not show the actual file being added to the assets directory, so we cannot verify the correct file name was used.",
